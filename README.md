## Training:

-  [x] Write a program that asks for two numbers and writes to the screen which is the greater.
-  [x] Write a program that asks for 3 numbers and writes the largest of the three to the screen.
-  [x] Write a program that asks for a number and tells if it is divisible by 2
-  [x] Write a program that asks for a phrase and writes how many times the letter a appears.
-  [x] Write a program that asks for a phrase and writes the vowels that appear
-  [x] Write a program that asks for a phrase and writes how many vowels are in the phrase.
-  [x] Write a program that asks for a phrase and writes how many times each of the vowels appears
-  [x] Write a program that asks for a number and tells us if it is divisible by 2, 3, 5 or 7 (you just have to check if it is divisible by one of the four)
-  [x] Add to the previous exercise that tells us by which of the four it is divisible (we must say all by which it is divisible)
-  [x] Write a program that prints the divisors of a given number to the screen.
-  [ ] Write a program that prints to the screen the common divisors of two given numbers.
-  [ ] Write a program that tells us if a given number is prime (it is not divisible by any number other than itself or the unit)

## Requirement:
